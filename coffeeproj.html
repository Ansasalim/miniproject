        <br><br>
        <p>
            cappuccino is a coffee drink made from a mixture of espresso and steamed milk. A traditional Italian
            cappuccino is generally a single (or sometimes a double) espresso shot topped with <br>equal parts steamed
            and
            frothed milk (in a ratio of 1:1:1). Many Americans have adapted this recipe, using more steamed and frothed
            milk for a milder espresso flavor and a richer taste.
            To make a Hot Cappuccino, a classic espresso drink offering frothy, bold deliciousness, we combine espresso
            with
            steamed milk, then top it with a thick layer of milk foam. For a refreshing Iced Cappuccino, we combine
            espresso
            with cold milk, then pour it over ice and top it with a thick layer of milk foam.​
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of Italy, cappuccino is a coffee drink that today is typically composed of a single espresso shot
            and hot milk, with the surface topped with foamed milk.[2] Cappuccinos are most often prepared with an
            espresso machine. The espresso is poured into the bottom of the cup, followed by a similar amount of hot
            milk, which is prepared by heating and texturing the milk using the espresso machine steam wand. The top
            third of the drink consists of milk foam; this foam can be decorated with artistic drawings made with the
            same milk, called latte art.</p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <p>  In a traditional cappuccino, as served in Europe and artisan coffee houses in the United States, the total
        of espresso and milk/foam make up between approximately 150 and 180 ml (5 and 6 imp fl oz; 5 and 6 US fl
        oz). Commercial coffee restaurant chains in the US more often serve the cappuccino as a 360 ml (13 imp fl
        oz; 12 US fl oz) drink or larger. In Italy, a cappuccino consists of 25 ml (1 imp fl oz; 1 US fl oz) of
        espresso; the rest of the cup is filled with equal parts of milk and foam. Outside of Italy, the
        ratios of espresso, milk, and foam typically equal 1/3 each.
    </p> 
        <p>Cappuccino is traditionally small (180 ml maximum) with a thick layer of foam, while "latte" traditionally
        is larger (200–300 ml). Caffè latte is often served in a large glass; cappuccino mostly in a 150–180 ml cup
        with a handle. Cappuccino traditionally has a layer of textured milk microfoam exceeding 1 cm in thickness;
        microfoam is frothed/steamed milk in which the bubbles are so small and so numerous that they are not seen,
        but it makes the milk lighter and thicker. As a result, the microfoam will remain partly on top of the mug
        when the espresso is poured in correctly as well as mix well with the rest of the cappuccino.
    </p>
        <p>The World Barista Championships have been arranged annually since 2000, and during the course of the
        competition, the competing barista must produce—for four sensory judges—among other drinks four cappuccinos,
        defined in WBC Rules and Regulations as  a coffee and milk beverage that should produce a harmonious
        balance of rich, sweet milk and espresso The cappuccino is prepared with one (1) single shot of
        espresso, textured milk and foam. ("Textured milk" is milk that has been aerated to its proper foam
        level.)[9] A minimum of 1 centimeter of foam depth A cappuccino is a beverage between 150 ml and 180
        ml in total volum
